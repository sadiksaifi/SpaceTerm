# SpaceTerm Context

This document is canonical for SpaceTerm's product intent, technology decisions, UI constraints,
and architectural principles. Domain terminology, relationships, and invariants are canonical in
`docs/UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md`.

## Product intent

SpaceTerm is a functional prototype of a modern native macOS terminal. Its layout hierarchy takes
useful inspiration from tmux, but SpaceTerm is not a tmux client and has no tmux-style server/client
model.

## Technology decisions

- Use Rust 2024 and GPUI for native UI and GPU rendering.
- Use `libghostty-vt` for terminal emulation.
- Use a macOS PTY to launch and communicate with shells.
- Use `gpui-symbols` for native macOS SF Symbols.
- Support macOS only; do not create Linux or Windows abstractions.
- Treat Vague as the only application and terminal theme and as the source of all brand colors.
  Reuse the tokens in `src/theme.rs`; never hardcode or redefine colors in UI, terminal, platform,
  or domain code.
- Prefer `JetBrainsMono Nerd Font` for terminal text and use a sensible system monospace fallback
  when it is unavailable.

## UI direction

- Build the interface directly with GPUI as a compact, Zed-like desktop experience.
- Use `gpui-symbols` for icons and native macOS menus and system dialogs where appropriate.
- Keep reusable SpaceTerm controls in a small internal UI Module.

## Architecture principles

### Deep Modules

Prefer Modules with a small Interface, significant hidden Implementation, and strong invariants.
Do not expose terminal emulation, PTY ownership, or Pane Layout mechanics throughout the UI.

### Narrow Interfaces

Keep Interfaces focused on what their callers need. Avoid broad traits with unrelated methods,
and do not pass application-wide state into every Module.

### Dependency injection

Use constructor injection and explicit ownership at meaningful replaceability Seams such as
Terminal Session creation, PTY creation, and platform integration. Inject clocks or scheduling only
when needed. Domain Modules own hierarchy identity allocation; do not recreate identity counters in
the UI. Avoid global mutable singletons and unnecessary factory layers.

### Policy and mechanism

Keep product policy, including minimum entity counts and focus fallback, inside testable domain
Modules. Keep GPUI rendering, PTY syscalls, and Ghostty integration outside the domain model.

### Encapsulation

Express domain changes through intentional operations such as `create_workspace`,
`close_workspace`, `create_window`, `close_window`, `split_pane`, `close_pane`, `focus_pane`, and
`resize_split`. Do not permit arbitrary external mutation of collections or active and focused
identities.

### Error handling

Use typed errors when callers must handle failure and attach actionable context to infrastructure
errors. Do not use `unwrap()` or `expect()` in ordinary runtime paths unless a documented invariant
makes failure impossible. Never silently ignore PTY, process, or terminal-emulation errors.

### Simplicity

Prefer one application crate with well-designed Modules over a workspace of small crates. Add
abstractions only when they create a meaningful Seam, Leverage, or Locality.

## Current architectural decisions

### Overlay Scrollbar

The Overlay Scrollbar is a compact vertical control that presents scroll position without reserving
layout space. It owns thumb geometry, transient visibility, hover retention, drag capture, and
Vague-themed rendering. Terminal Scrollback and the Workspace list adapt their native offset units
at its Interface.

### Identity Ownership

Each hierarchy Module allocates the identities it owns. `WorkspaceCollection` allocates Workspace
IDs, `WindowCollection` allocates Window IDs, and `TerminalWindow` allocates Pane and Split IDs.
Creation factories receive the generated identity so infrastructure can bind events without
manufacturing domain state. Identities are monotonic and are not reused after deletion.

### Native PTY Owner

`SpawnedPty` exclusively owns the macOS PTY master, reader, writer, and Shell Process cleanup. The
terminal worker uses its narrow read acquisition, resize, write, wait, and termination Interfaces
without reaching into platform handles.
